Welcome to the Assignments Repository! This repository contains a collection of assignments, each designed to help you grasp various concepts related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and other relevant topics. Below is a brief overview of each assignment along with the corresponding course outcomes (CO) they align with.

## Assignment 1: Classes and Objects (CO1, CO2)
Task: Design a class named 'Complex' with real and imaginary parts as data members. Implement default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic operations on two complex numbers.

## Assignment 2: Polymorphism (CO3)
Task: Identify commonalities and differences between Publication, Book, and Magazine classes. Implement these classes and find the number of ordered books and total sales of publications.

## Assignment 3: Inheritance (CO3)
Task: Design an inheritance structure for an Employee class, inheriting from it: Programmer, Team Lead, Assistant Project Manager, and Project Manager. Calculate and display pay slips for each employee, considering various allowances.

## Assignment 4: Dynamic Binding (CO3)
Task: Design a base class 'Shape' with methods for inputting data and calculating the area. Derive two classes, 'Triangle' and 'Rectangle', overriding the area calculation method. Implement dynamic binding for this scenario.

## Assignment 5: Interface (CO1, CO3)
Task: Create an interface for Vehicles, including common functionalities like Gear Change, Speed Up, and Apply Brakes. Implement these functionalities differently in the Bicycle, Bike, and Car classes.

## Assignment 6: Exception Handling (CO4)
Task: Implement a program to handle Arithmetic and Array Index Out of Bounds exceptions. Ensure proper handling for Number Format and Division by Zero exceptions when the user enters two numbers.

## Assignment 7: Template (CO4)
Task: Develop a generic program using a collection class to count elements with specific properties, such as even numbers, odd numbers, prime numbers, and palindromes.

## Assignment 8: File Handling (CO5)
Task: Create a program to maintain a student records database using files. Implement functions to create, display, delete, update, and search for student records.

## Assignment 9: Case Study (CO2, CO5)
Task: Solve a real-world problem using OOP principles. Choose either a Banking System or Inventory Management System and implement the specified operations.

## Assignment 10: Factory Design Pattern (CO6)
Task: Implement the Factory Design Pattern for a Car Building Process. Subclasses like Hatchback, Sedan, and SUV should be created for different car types. Implement the Car class, its subclasses, and a CarFactory.

## Assignment 11: Strategy Design Pattern (CO6)
Task: Apply the Strategy Design Pattern to a simple Shopping Cart. Implement three payment strategies: Credit Card, PayPal, and Bit Coin, using an interface for strategy pattern.
